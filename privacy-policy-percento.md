Privacy Policy for Percent-O

Effective date: December 15, 2025 Last updated: December 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how “Percent-O” (“the App”) by Marc Picco (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information. If you have any questions, contact us at marc.picco@gmail.com.

1. Summary

We do not create user accounts and do not collect contact information within the App.

The App displays advertisements via Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Google may process device and ad‑related information to deliver personalized advertisements.

The App offers in‑app purchases (IAP) to remove ads. Apple processes payments; we receive limited transaction information necessary to grant entitlements.

We do not operate our own servers for user data. App settings and game scores are stored locally on your device.

2. Information We Collect and Use

a) Advertising (AdMob) The App integrates the Google Mobile Ads SDK to show advertisements. To deliver relevant ads and measure performance, Google may collect and process:

Identifiers: Device ID (such as the Advertising Identifier/IDFA).

Location: Coarse location data derived from IP address.

Usage Data: Interaction with ads (clicks, views) and app launch data.

Diagnostics: Crash logs and performance data related to the ad SDK.

Google may use this data to serve personalized ads ("tracking") across other apps and websites.

Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) SDK & Privacy: https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/privacy

b) Purchases (StoreKit) When you buy “Remove Ads,” Apple processes the transaction. We receive transaction status and product identifiers to apply entitlements (e.g., “ads removed”) to your device. We do not receive your payment details or credit card info.

Apple’s Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

c) App Data Stored on Device We store minimal data locally on your device (using iOS UserDefaults or SwiftData), including:

Purchase status (Ads Removed: Yes/No)

High scores, "Stanine" results, and game history

App preferences (e.g., haptic feedback settings) This data does not leave your device, except as necessary for Apple or the Google Mobile Ads SDK to function as described above.

d) Crash Logs / Diagnostics While we do not use a standalone analytics platform, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect diagnostic, crash, and performance data to ensure the stability and security of the ad-serving system.

3. How We Use Information

Advertising: To deliver third-party advertisements via Google AdMob.

Commerce: To process purchases and restore entitlements via Apple StoreKit.

Functionality: To maintain app preferences and save local game progress.

4. Sharing of Information

With Google (AdMob): To serve advertisements and monitor ad performance.

With Apple (StoreKit): To process secure payments.

We do not sell personal information directly. However, allowing Google to collect data for personalized advertising may be considered "sharing" or "tracking" under Apple's privacy definitions.

5. Data Retention

Local Data: Settings and scores remain on your device until the App is deleted or you reset them.

Ad Data: Ad‑related data is handled by Google according to their policies.

Purchase Data: Purchase history is retained by Apple.

6. Your Choices

Remove Ads: You can purchase the “Remove Ads” in‑app purchase. After activation, the App stops loading the AdMob SDK, meaning no further ad data is collected.

Ad Tracking: You can limit ad tracking by disabling "Allow Apps to Request to Track" in your iOS Settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).

Reset ID: You can reset your Advertising Identifier in iOS Settings.

7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us and we will address it.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. Changes will be posted at: https://somekindofgitusername.github.io/Feel-O-Support/privacy-policy-percento.md
