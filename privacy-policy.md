Privacy Policy for Feel‑O

Effective date: 2025‑01‑01
Last updated: 2025‑01‑01

This Privacy Policy explains how “Feel‑O” (“the App”) by Your Company Name (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information. If you have any questions, contact us at support@example.com.

1. Summary
• We do not create user accounts and do not collect contact information within the App.
• The App displays advertisements via Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). Google may process device and ad‑related information to deliver ads. We request non‑personalized ads where available.
• The App offers in‑app purchases (IAP) to remove ads. Apple processes payment; we receive limited transaction information necessary to grant entitlements.
• We do not operate our own servers for user data. Limited app settings are stored locally on the device.

2. Information We Collect and Use
a) Advertising (AdMob)
• The App integrates the Google Mobile Ads SDK to show interstitial ads.
• Data that may be processed by Google includes device identifiers, IP address, coarse location (derived), and ad interaction data. We request non‑personalized ads by setting “npa=1” when supported by the SDK.

   • Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) SDK & privacy: https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/privacy

b) Purchases (StoreKit)
• When you buy “Remove Ads,” Apple processes the transaction. We receive transaction status and product identifiers to apply entitlements (e.g., “ads removed”) to your device.
• We do not receive your payment details.
• Apple’s policies: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

c) App Data Stored on Device
• We store minimal settings in iOS UserDefaults, such as:
   • Whether ads were removed (entitlement state)
   • Timestamps needed to control ad frequency
   • Basic gameplay preferences (e.g., speed/haptic settings)
• This data does not leave your device, except as necessary for Apple or the ad SDK to function as described above.

d) Crash Logs / Diagnostics
• We do not integrate third‑party analytics. Apple may provide anonymized crash and usage analytics if you have opted in at the system level. We do not receive personally identifying information from these reports.

3. How We Use Information
• Deliver and control frequency of ads
• Process purchases and restore entitlements
• Maintain app functionality and preferences

4. Sharing of Information
• With Google (AdMob) to serve ads in the App (see links above)
• With Apple (StoreKit) to process purchases
• We do not sell personal information. We do not share information with other third parties for their own marketing.

5. Data Retention
• Local settings remain on your device until the App is deleted or you reset them.
• Ad‑related data is handled by Google according to their policies (see Google links).
• Purchase history is retained by Apple and available to you for restore; we do not store your payment details.

6. Your Choices
• Remove Ads: You can purchase the “Remove Ads” in‑app purchase; after activation, the App stops loading and showing ads.
• Ad Personalization: We request non‑personalized ads where available. You can further manage ad preferences per Google’s guidance and your device settings. See “User Privacy Choices” for details.
• System Settings: You can limit ad tracking and reset your advertising identifier in iOS Settings.

7. Children’s Privacy
• The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us and we will address it.

8. International Transfers
• Ad services may process data on servers outside your country. See Google’s policies for details on data locations and safeguards.

9. Changes to This Policy
